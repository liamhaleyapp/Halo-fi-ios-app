# QUICK FIX: Get Your Logo Displaying Right Now!

## **Immediate Solution:**

Since the app is looking for `Image("HaloFiLogo")` but finding no image files, you have two options:

### **Option 1: Add Your Real Logo (Best)**
1. Open Xcode
2. Go to `Assets.xcassets` → `HaloFiLogo`
3. Drag your logo PNG files to the size slots:
   - 1x: 120x120px
   - 2x: 240x240px
   - 3x: 360x360px

### **Option 2: Quick Test with System Icon**
If you want to test immediately, temporarily change the code to use a system icon:

**In OnboardingView.swift, change:**
```swift
Image("HaloFiLogo")  // ← This line
```

**To:**
```swift
Image(systemName: "h.circle.fill")  // ← Temporary test
```

This will show an "H" icon instead of the microphone, so you can see the layout working.

### **Option 3: Use the SVG I Created**
1. Open the `logo_placeholder.svg` file I created
2. Convert it to PNG using any online converter
3. Save as 120x120px, 240x240px, and 360x360px
4. Add to the image set in Xcode

## **Why This Happened:**
- The app code is correct and looking for `HaloFiLogo`
- But the image set has no actual image files
- Xcode falls back to default behavior (showing nothing or system icons)

**Your logo will appear as soon as you add PNG files to the image set!**
